The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data.\nChoose the data based on your group’s interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a data set to analyze and communicate it in a meaningful way.\nAll analyses must be done in Python, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the final presentation) placed inside the provided GitHub repo."

Assume that it will be used to communicate your results to other colleagues who are interested in your findings.\nAll team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nYou also need to submit the HTML of your final report in Moodle (the HTML you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly).\nThe mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the topics stated in the file.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n7 pts\n\n\nVisualizations\n20 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n8 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n5 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for an overview of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and (research) question (main content from the Big Idea Worksheet). Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nVisualizations\nThis section includes a profound description of your visualization selection and creation process (with regard to the topics covered in our course). Explain the reasoning for the type of visualization considered for the project. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final visualizaion by describing the selection process, variable transformations (if needed) and any other relevant considerations that were part of the creation process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe selection steps are appropriate for the data and (research) question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final visualization(s); the approach is clearly described in the report. The visualization selection process took into account the aspects covered in the course (law of proximity, …). If violations of optimal visualization conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nConclusion + recommended action\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your (research) question along with (statistical) arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.\nAny potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include your recommended action.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the visualization results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original (research) question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis. The recommended action is plausible/convincing and clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are similar formatted as the examples shown in this course.\nAll citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

These slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your report and will be graded for content and quality.\nIf your presentation slides are online, you can put a link to the slides in a README.md file in the reports/ folder.\nFor submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document, and submit the file on Moodle.\nThe slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide.
